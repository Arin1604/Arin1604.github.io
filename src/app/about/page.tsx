          Hi, I’m Arin Idhant — a creative technologist with a passion for camera systems, real-time 3D, and computer graphics.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
          I'm currently working on a VR teleoperation project using Boston Dynamics Spot, building tools in Unity and C#, and developing a physically-based ray tracer from scratch.

        <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
          I love combining storytelling with technology, especially through real-time rendering, filmmaking, and immersive interaction.
