        <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
          Hey! I’m Arin Idhant, a creative technologist passionate about camera systems,
          computer graphics, and real-time 3D. I’m currently pursuing my studies in the U.S.
          and have worked across research, immersive media, and filmmaking.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
          My recent work includes contributing to a VR teleoperation project using the Boston Dynamics Spot robot,
          building tools in Unity and C#, and developing a physically-based ray tracer from scratch.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
          Outside of tech, I enjoy exploring visual storytelling, writing tools for Maya, and experimenting
          with real-time shaders.
